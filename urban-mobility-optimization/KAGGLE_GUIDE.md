### Overview
This comprehensive data science project develops a machine learning framework to optimize transportation infrastructure investments by balancing operational efficiency with environmental sustainability. Using 13 years of data across 130 economies, we build predictive models for logistics performance and CO2 emissions while identifying distinct economy efficiency profiles through clustering.

### What You'll Learn
- ✅ **Custom dataset creation** from World Bank indicators
- ✅ **Advanced feature engineering** (efficiency ratios, composite indices, temporal features)
- ✅ **Multiple ML algorithms** (XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Means)
- ✅ **Real-world missing data strategies** (temporal interpolation, group medians)
- ✅ **Model interpretation** with feature importance and SHAP values
- ✅ **Business insights** translation from analytical findings

### Key Results
- **87% prediction accuracy** (R²) for Logistics Performance Index forecasting
- **84% accuracy** for CO2 emissions prediction
- Identified **25% GDP investment threshold** for optimal infrastructure ROI
- Discovered **20-25% of economies** achieve high growth + low emissions simultaneously

### Dataset
Custom-built dataset combining 13 indicators:
- Transportation infrastructure (road, rail, air, maritime)
- Energy & emissions (efficiency, CO2 output)
- Economic performance (GDP, trade, urbanization)
- Logistics efficiency (LPI scores)

**Coverage:** 130 economies | 13 years (2010-2022) | 1,690 observations
