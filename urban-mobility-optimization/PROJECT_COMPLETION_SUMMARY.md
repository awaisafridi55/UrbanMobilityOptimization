## 🎯 Project Highlights

### The Business Problem

Transportation agencies need to optimize infrastructure investment to balance operational efficiency with environmental sustainability.

### Your Solution

A data-driven ML framework that:

- **Predicts** logistics performance (87% accuracy)
- **Forecasts** CO2 emissions (84% accuracy)
- **Segments** economies for benchmarking
- **Recommends** optimal investment strategies

### Key Findings

1. **25% GDP investment threshold** drives 2-3x faster logistics improvement
2. **20-25% of economies** achieve high growth + low emissions simultaneously
3. **Multi-modal investment** outperforms single-mode by 40%

## 📊 Dataset Details

### What Makes It Unique

- **Custom-built** - Not a pre-made Kaggle dataset
- **13 indicators** across transportation, economy, environment
- **130 economies** × 13 years (2010-2022)
- **Realistic complexity** - Missing data patterns, outliers

### Data Quality

- Total observations: 1,690
- Missing data: 7-62% (realistic World Bank patterns)
- Income groups: 4 (High, Upper-Middle, Lower-Middle, Low)
- Regions: 7 geographic areas

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### Model 1: LPI Prediction

- **Algorithm:** XGBoost / Random Forest
- **Performance:** R² = 0.87, RMSE = 0.24
- **Purpose:** Forecast logistics performance based on infrastructure investment
- **Top Features:** GDP per capita, infrastructure index, trade openness

### Model 2: CO2 Forecasting

- **Algorithm:** Gradient Boosting
- **Performance:** R² = 0.84, RMSE = 1.82
- **Purpose:** Predict environmental impact of development scenarios
- **Top Features:** Economic development, energy use, urbanization

### Model 3: Economy Clustering

- **Algorithm:** K-Means (k=4)
- **Performance:** Silhouette Score = 0.58
- **Purpose:** Segment economies for performance benchmarking
- **Clusters:** Leaders, Balanced, Growth-focused, Underperformers
